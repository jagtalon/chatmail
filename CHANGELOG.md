# Changelog for chatmail deployment 

## untagged

- BREAKING: new required chatmail.ini values:

  mailboxes_dir = /home/vmail/mail/{mail_domain}
  passdb = /home/vmail/passdb.sqlite
  
  reducing hardcoding these two paths all over the files, also improving testability. 
  ([#351](https://github.com/deltachat/chatmail/pull/351))

- BREAKING: new required chatmail.ini value 'delete_inactive_users_after = 100'
  which removes users from database and mails after 100 days without any login. 
  ([#350](https://github.com/deltachat/chatmail/pull/350))

- remove checking of reverse-DNS PTR records.  Chatmail-servers don't
  depend on it and even in the wider e-mail system it's not common anymore. 
  If it's an issue, a chatmail operator can still care to properly set reverse DNS. 
  ([#348](https://github.com/deltachat/chatmail/pull/348))

- Make DNS-checking faster and more interactive, run it fully during "cmdeploy run",
  also introducing a generic mechanism for rapid remote ssh-based python function execution.
