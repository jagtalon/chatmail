# Chika, a private email service designed for [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat) 

Welcome to [instant, interoperable, and privacy-centric email service](https://delta.chat/chatmail) run by [Aangat Lahat](https://aangat.lahat.computer). It has the following features and limitations:

- You can create as many accounts as you want.
- Messages are automatically deleted on the server after 7 days. Messages will remain on your phone/computer unless you don't log in to Delta Chat for 7 days.
- Only encrypted emails are allowed when sending (thankfully Delta Chat does that for you), but you can receive unencrypted email (to receive newsletters, for example).
- No phone numbers, other email addresses, names, etc. are needed for an account. Feel free to use [Tor Browser](https://torproject.org) and [Orbot](https://orbot.app/) when you're signing up and using the service as well.

## Creating an account:
