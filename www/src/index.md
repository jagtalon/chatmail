# Chika, a service designed for [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat) users 

Welcome to [instant, interoperable, and privacy-centric chat](https://delta.chat/chatmail) run by [Aangat Lahat](https://aangat.lahat.computer) / [Durian Distro](https://durian-distro.org/). 

[Delta Chat](https://delta.chat) is a decentralized messenger that allows people to chat with each other even if they're on different servers. This is just one of [many](https://delta.chat/chatmail), and it has the following features:

- No phone numbers, email addresses, real names, etc. are needed for an account.
- {{ config.max_mailbox_size }} of storage space for users.
- Server keeps messages for {{ config.delete_mails_after }} days. 
    - (Don't worry this only affects you if you don't open the app in this time.)
- It prohibits sending out unencrypted messages.
- It does not store IP addresses.
- Inactive accounts are deleted after 2 years.

Feel free to use [Tor Browser](https://torproject.org), [Orbot](https://orbot.app/), or a trusted VPN when you're using this service as well for increased privacy.
